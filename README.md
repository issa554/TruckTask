## ðŸ§  AI-Driven Development Workflow
AI was used throughout the project in:
| Phase                          | How AI Was Used                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Stories & Assumptions** | Prompted AI to define user stories, acceptance criteria, and assumptions.                |
| **Backend Development**        | Ask him to build backend base on prev Phase                                              |
| **Frontend UI**                | Ask him to build frontend Base on prev Phases                                            |
| **Testing**                    | Ask him to build unit and itergtion test base on backend service and APIs                |
